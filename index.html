        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Mia Rodriguez <br><br>

       I am a dedicated professional with a diverse background spanning from research and lab work to creative roles in signage design. I recently joined Edikted, where I’m excited to bring my enthusiasm for fashion and customer service to life. With my experience working in both independent and collaborative settings, I bring a unique balance of creativity, precision, and problem-solving skills to any role I take on.

I graduated from the University of California, Riverside, where I honed my research skills as an Undergraduate Research Assistant in the Van Norman lab. During my time there, I focused on studying the role of receptor-like kinases (RLKs) in plant development, particularly within the MEE62 gene subgroup. This experience introduced me to essential lab skills such as PCR, bacterial and plant sample preparation, and data entry, while fostering my understanding of genetic research and molecular biology. My research background also strengthened my analytical abilities, attention to detail, and adaptability, which have proven invaluable as I ventured into different fields.

Currently, I manage the signage department at UCR, a role that combines my creative strengths with technical expertise. As the sole designer, I am responsible for updating, designing, and overseeing the installation of all campus directional and transportation signs. Working with software like Flexi and Dr. Engrave, I create templates, design custom event signage, and operate engraving and printing machines. This experience has deepened my understanding of materials like vinyl, metal, and plastic, and allowed me to develop organizational and project management skills. I take pride in designing signage that enhances the campus experience for students and visitors alike. Additionally, I handle access assignments for restricted campus areas, utilizing specialized software to ensure efficient campus navigation and security.

Beyond my academic and professional roles, I enjoy exploring new interests, such as gardening, which connects me to nature and reflects my commitment to growth in every area of my life. Recently, I’ve been focused on pushing myself outside of my comfort zone, taking on new opportunities and challenges that broaden my perspective. This mindset has led me to take up additional studies, including bioinformatics, genomics, coding, and African literature, giving me a more interdisciplinary foundation and helping me develop a more holistic approach to problem-solving.

My past work experience as an ice cream scooper and a teacher’s assistant, as well as volunteering in a high school office, taught me the value of communication, patience, and attention to detail. I’ve always enjoyed connecting with people, whether it’s assisting customers, supporting classmates, or guiding colleagues. I thrive in dynamic environments where I can blend technical expertise with creativity and collaboration.

As I continue to explore opportunities for personal and professional growth, my goal is to build a career where I can utilize my skills in research, creativity, and problem-solving. I am open to new challenges and excited to contribute meaningfully wherever I can make a difference.<br><br>
